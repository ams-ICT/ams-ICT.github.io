<h3><b>Task 3: How to Clean-Cut or Put Images on a Transparent Background</b></h3>
<p>In this activity you will learn how to clear-cut PSD images.</p>
<p>What is clear-cutting an image? </p>
<p>Cutting an image simply means removing the original background so that the focus of the canvas is just one object. 
The benefit of using a clean-cut image is being able to place the image on any background you choose. 
This is a great technique to learn when using images on websites or posters. 
In addition, you can also use clear-cut images on signs, banners, and icons without dealing 
with distracting backgrounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is PSD?</p>
<p>PSD is simply Photoshop's special image (or photo) format. 
You have heard of JPEG (which is the most common format) or GIF formats. 
Most photographs on the internet are in JPEG format. 
PSD formatted images usually work better in Photoshop, so this is the format we will be using in this activity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Why use PSD? </p>
<p>When we are editing images we need to store a lot more information than when we present the same image in the final production.  We use the PSD format as it contains information about layers, and much more information about the image so that we lose less information when we edit the picture.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>To start with, you will need to select an image to work with.</b> Make sure the image will be easy to work with.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up your picture as a canvas in Photoshop. Always make sure the image is saved so you have the original to refer back to.</li>
<li>On your keyboard, hold down CRTL+A to select the entire image.</li>
<li>Next, hold down CTRL+C. </li>
<li>Then go to File -> New. This will make a copy of the image but with a background that is transparent. The image will also stay the same size. Click OK after.</li>
<li>Hold down CRTL+V to then paste the image.</li>
<li>Now you will work with the <b>Polygon Lasso Tool</b>, located on the <b>vertical menu bar</b>. Drag the tool around the part of the image you want to cut out and then hit the Delete key. If you end up deleting the wrong part, go to Select> Inverse to change the selection. This will allow you to cut the correct part.</li>
<li>You will now need to deselect the area. Hold down CRTL+D.</li>
<li>Choose the eraser tool and set it to a large size with a hardness of about 80-100.</li>
<li>Zoom in close to the edges of the pictures and erase the unwanted areas that were not deleted in the previous steps. This will insure a better end product.</li>
<li>Now save the image in PSD format and you're done with a perfectly cut image! Normally we then export the image to a different format depending on what we want to use the oimage for.</li>

<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Original-teeth-image.jpg">
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure other corrections are done before applying teeth whitening</li>
<p>It’s important to ensure that you have applied all edits, such as contrast, levels, colour and saturation before you start the teeth whitening edits.</p> 
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Curves-hue-saturation-brightness-contrast.jpg">
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/After-Edit.jpg">
<p></p>
<li>Duplicate the layer and select your edit</li>
<p>The next step is to duplicate the layer. It can be helpful to name it something like ‘teeth whitening’ or similar for reference. Once this is done, you can select the area you want to edit – in this case, the teeth.</p>
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Duplicate-the-layer.png">
<p></p>
<li>Using The Pen Tool</li>
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Keyboard.png">
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Pen-tool.png">
<p></p>
<li>Using Paths</li>
<p>Before you start, make sure you have ‘paths’ selected (found in the top left hand corner).</p>
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Paths-select.png">
<p></p>
<p>You can then simply click to set the path points around the teeth, making sure that you click and hold, then move up or down to adjust curves as necessary. Remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect, as long as you have all the teeth outlined.(Complete Task 4: Learn 5 uses of clipping path to get the idea about some ways to apply the paths technique.)<p>
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Drawn-Path-around-the-teeths.png">
<p></p>
<li>Selecting and Feathering</li>
<p>Once you have your outline, right click and ‘make selection’. It can be useful to feather (the 1 pixel setting will be enough) just to smooth out the edges. Then, simply copy and paste the selection, where you can start adjusting the hues and tone as preferred.</p>
<p></p>
<img src="Graphics_image/Make-selection-and-feather.png">
<p></p>
<li>Whitening the teeth</li>
<p></p>
<p>Once back in standard mode with your selection active, you can adjust the <b>hues and tone</b> of the teeth by setting the hue/saturation to yellow, value around 80, in the main menu (Image – Adjustments – Hue/Saturation). Use the dodge tool, and set range to midtones and exposure to around 15%. You can then use a large brush that covers your selection to make teeth look whiter.</p>
